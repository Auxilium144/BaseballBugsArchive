The bleachers 
gave a 
The grandstand

Joined its roar I 
Bawled loudly for 
press-b 
But ere their wrath vented 
McCarthy grabbed the bat 
That knocked that honest homer 
And laid the umpire flat. 
Up rushed the other Wolves then 
Their heels in him they dug, 
And the punches they rained on him 
Made jelly out of "Pug ! "

They made the umpire shapeless 
By stamping on his form ! 
Cried police, judges, preacher: 
"Leave not a shred of him !" 
Save Bisonburg, the land cried : 
"He earned it! Devil's limb ! " 
They buried "Pug," unprayed-for, 
In marshy, worthless land, 
And no one ever dreamed that he 
Just such a death had planned,
