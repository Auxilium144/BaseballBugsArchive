Base Ball Fans.
The bleachers gave a war-whoop! 
	The grandstand joined its roar!
The scribes within the press-box,
	Bawled loudly for "Pug's" gore!
But ere their was wrath vented,
	McCarthy grabbed the bat 
That knocked that honest homer,
	And laid the umpire flat. 
Up rushed the other Wolves then, 
	Their heels in him they dug, 
And the punches they rained on him 
	Made jelly out of "Pug!" 
Up came the maddened rooters, 
	A fierce, blood-thirsty swarm, 
They made the umpire shapeless 
	By stamping on his form ! 
Cried police, judges, preacher: 
	"Leave not a shred of him!" 
Save Bisonburg, the land cried:
	"He earned it! Devil's limb!" 
They buried "Pug," unprayed-for, 
	In marshy, worthless land, 
And no one ever dreamed that he 
	Just such a death had planned, 
—D.M. HENDERSON, Jr.
