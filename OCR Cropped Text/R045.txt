Base Ball Fans.
Some Don't for the Ball Fan. 
Don't leave until the game is over, the last lap 
has often won the game. 
Don't blackguard the "ump," he is better posted
than you are, and just as honest.
Don't shout your lungs away, you'll need them in 
your business. 
Don't think you have an exclusive line on the 
dope, your neighbor may be as well posted as you. 
Don't get familiar with players names while they 
are on the field, they might not recognize you, 
Don't tell your neighbor the home team might 
have won if they had taken your shouts as good 
horse sense, the manager gives advice.
