A Good-Natured Josh
  A Southern League player tells a yarn on a mem-
ber of the Boston Americans.
  "The beanerite at the time was playing amateur
ball in a little Texas town called Hubbard City, and
Shelton, a great kidder, was managing Temple, Tex.
He wanted a pitcher and the S.L man told him of 
the Boston guy. Shelton wired him and the kid came
on the first train. Next day he was put in the box
and the life hammered out of him, the opponents
making nineteen hits in five innings. In that inning
the Boston party asked Shelton what he thought of 
his work. Shelton smiled, saying: "Young man, 
you are doing splendid. They've not made a single
off of you yet; although they have made a nineteen 
hits- all doubles, triples and homers." Bean eater
never tumbled.

with a dediced Teutonic accent approached the Vice-
President of a Chicago bank, who is also a rabid
bug, and vociferously shouted to the V.P.: "Say,
who is vat is going to vin dose post-mortem games
ha?" Can you beat it?
