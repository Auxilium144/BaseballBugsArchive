By a 2-bagger? Who would roastings bear, 
To grunt and swear under a weary game, 
But that the dread of somethiug after it, 
The Minor Leagues, from whose ranks 
No old time star returns, startles the mind;- 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
Than fly to others whence we ne'er return? 
These bleachers do make cowards of us all; 
And thus the fumble of a hard-hit grounder, 
Is yelled at by the bleacher mob, 
And, thus in places of great chance and moment, 
We all make bone-head plays that lose the game.

Rubber Heels, 'an' Ah went home an' chewed a 
piece ob rubbah all day, an' de nex' day Ah wuz 
sicker dan eber. No, sah; Ah don't beliebe in no 
signs."
