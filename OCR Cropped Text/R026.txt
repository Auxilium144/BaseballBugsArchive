Base Ball Fans.
A Good Scheme.
Some ball players shirk in their work just as lazy 
men do in factories or in other branches of labor, 
according to an Eastern magnate. 
Many ingenious excuses to obtain holidays have 
been framed up, but we used to have a fellow who 
wasn't satisfied with verbal excuses, but who actual- 
ly disabled himself. He was expert at bunting, and 
could judge a pitched ball so closely that he could 
hit with any part of his bat. One day he was acci- 
dentally hit on the index finger of his right hand, 
the digit being crushed so that he was unfit for duty 
for two weeks. Well, after that he used to smash a 
finger regularly, varying the trick occasionally by 
letting the ball hit his second finger. 
"As a result of his conniving, he played only thir- 
ty garnes that season, and drew full pay. He 
became known as the champion hard luck' player."

"Does your wife object to late dinners?" 
"It all depends," said Mr. Meekton, "on whether
the cause is a baseball game or manitee."
