Ilave you Imcarcl about tbc scandal 
That involves a statesman great? 
And a banker and a minister, 
And the ruler of a state ? 
They tell me—let me whisper 
G'wan! But by the way, 
I wonder can you tell me 
Who's in the box today? 
There's another big strike threatened, 
'Twill bring on a bitter strife, 
And the trusts have got a corner 
On the necessities of life. 
The people talk of looking 
For help to Theodore, 
And then—— 
A w, cut the piffle out, 
And tell me, what's the score? 
"Are you Hungary? " 
Yes, Siam." 
"Well, come along; I'll Fiji." This is not taken 
from the Matthewson or Evers stunt, nor any of the 
numerous lives of other athletic artists. 
Put not thy trust in yesterday's score.
