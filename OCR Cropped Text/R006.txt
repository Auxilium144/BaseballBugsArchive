APOLOGY 
It being now the fashion for our professional 
athletes to either elevate the stage or raise the 
standard of journalism to their own ground and lofty 
standards, the authors of this book have presumed 
to confiscate some of their laurels—aud two-bit 
pieces, if we can get them—just to let the budding 
thespians and embryo journalists realize that they 
must expect legitimate competition in their respect- 
ive lines of endeavor, and we hope that such stars as 
Cristie, Tinker Joe, Muggsy, Jim, the Callahan, Mike, 
and others yet to be heard from now on the diam- 
ond, will not lead us too hard a race in the pursuit of 
the aforementioned two-bits. 
We should not feel that our duty had been ac- 
complished if we overlooked the roped arena, and 
pay our respects also to those doughty warriors who 
are now recognized as members of the pen pushers 
aggregation, viz. : the czar of Hegewisch, Ill., and 
the peerless J. J. J. Now get ready to smile.
