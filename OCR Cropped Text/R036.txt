The Umpire.
Of all the inscrutable creatures there be 
A top of the earth or below in the sea. 
The ump is the beatenest being, sure, He 
Consorteth apart in mystery. 
His integument's blue, there's a pad on his chest, 
His frontal is masked and his features unguessed; 
On his mind is a cap, and—well, as for the rest 
Whatever it be, its the subject of jest. 
Oh, the ump's a pariah—the other team's tool 
He bawls out decisions and balls up each rule; 
He sure gets the vote 
As the champion goat; 
There is never a crowd to be in the same boat, 
The umps get their bumps, but this to b 
There is balm (vernal plasters) in Gilead. 
The ump is a seer who was born with a cad; 
The ump is a Solomon—under a pall ; 
One time he's the Saint, and the nest 
The ump's like the place Caesar tells of-all Gaul.
