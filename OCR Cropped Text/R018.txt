Base Ball Fans.
No wonder that "Pug" Dugan
	Wore a perpetual scowl,
No wonder that unto him
	Life's skies seemed ever foul!
For "Pug" a "has-been" pitcher,
	Now held an umpire's job,
And heard himself called daily:
	"Rube,""robber,""soak" and "slob"
"Pug" brooded o'er his troubles,
	The scowling, howling fans, 
The bickering, blustering players,
	The captains with their "damns!"
He swore that he no longer
	His troubles would endure,
And planned a way to end them
	That would be swift and sure!
That day, the Wolves, the home team, 
	The Bisons were to play.
The whole of Wolfburg journeyed
	To see their heroes play.
The Bisons led the leagues now, 
	But the Wolves held second place,
And if they beat the Bisons
	The wolves would lead the race.
