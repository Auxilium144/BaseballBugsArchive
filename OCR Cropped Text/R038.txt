Base Ball Fans.
Willie's Brother's Demise.
Willie was an office boy,
  Willie was a fan;
Willie knew more about baseball
  Than many an older man.
Wille said his brother
  Was sick as a man could be,
And "Please could he get off to day
  To bear bim companee?" 
"You may," the boss said gently,
  Gazing at Willie the while,
And Willie's look as he stood there
  Was totally free from guile.
His head bowed low with sorrow,
  He slowly went outside,
While gloom hung over the office,
  And the secretary cried.
Next day he showed up at the office,
  With a frown as black as night;
The Boss, with kindly manner,
  Inquired if all was not right.
