Base Ball Fans. 
The Batter's Soliloquy.
DONALD DOUGLASS 
Ninth Inning, man on third, two gone, and the score 2-2.
To wait, or not to wait,—that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in this game to suffer 
The taunts and yells of the outrageous fans, 
Or to dodge the curves and drops of an erratic 
pitcher, 
And, by my coolness 'scape them? To wait—to 
walk,—
No more; and by a walk to say we stroll 
To first, and then be daring like Ty Cobb, 
And work the Double Steal,—'tis a consummation 
Devoutly to be wished. To walk—to steal— 
To steal. Perchance to score. Ay, there's the rub;— 
For in that Double Steal what chance may come 
When we have rattled the opposing pitcher, 
Must give us runs; there's the respect 
That makes a walk of so long life; 
For who would bear the yells and taunts of fans, 
The urnpire's wrong, the bleachers' contumely, 
"The pangs of disprized hope, the games delay, 
The insolence of gamins, and the spurns 
That one must take from the unknowing 
When he himself his fame might make
