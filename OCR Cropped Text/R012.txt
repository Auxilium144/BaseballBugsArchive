Nitit!i I filling, 011 tllirdp two gone, Oild scoro 2-2. 
To wait, or not to wait,—that is the question : 
Whcthcr 'tis nobler in this game to suffer 
The taunts and yells of the outrageous fans, 
Or to dodge the curves and drops of an erratic 
pitcher, 
And, by 111 y coolness 'scape them? To wait—to 
walk, 
No more ; and by a walk to say we stroll 
To first, and then be daring like Ty Cobb, 
And work the Double Steal, 
—'tis a consummation 
Dcvoutly to be wished. To walk—to steal— 
ero steal. Perchance to score. Ay, there's the rub 
For in that Double Steal what chance may come 
When we have rattled the opposing pitcher, 
Must give us runs; there's the respect 
"I'hat n) alces a walk of so long life ; 
For who would bear the yells ancl taunts of fans, 
The urnpire's wrong, the bleachers' contumely, 
"IPhe pangs of disprized hope, the games delay, 
The insolence of gamins, and the spurns 
That one nltjst talce froin the unknowing 
When he himself his fame jnight make
