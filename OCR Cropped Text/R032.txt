Just Baseball.
The honey of spring was in the air
  The day was one for joy,
But he sat at his desk and didn't care
  And he growled at the office boy.

He nursed a big grouch--the world looked dark-
  He only grumbled and frowned; 
He grabbed his hat and went to the park 
  To see the home team downed.
 
For eight innings he sat—not a feeling of pride, 
  Though the game was close and fast;— 
He looked for defeat, though the game was tied 
When they took the field for the last.
 
Three men got on bases, chances looked slim,
  A score seemed as sure as fate.
He muttered a prayer, and his smile was grim 
  As the batter strode to the plate.
 
The pitcher gazed, his arm held high, 
  And smiling, tossed his head. 
The batter swung-the rooters sighted 
As the ball for the outfield sped.
