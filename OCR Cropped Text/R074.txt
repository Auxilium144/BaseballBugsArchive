ooney stingg tbc ball. 
When Murphy bunts, and 
e cheer his feat with 
gets to first 
The ball twists slowly down the line 
And never rolls outside. 
When Casey makes a sacrifice 
His deftness movves us all 
But, Oh, the real comes 
When Mooney stings the ball! 
For Mooney has a nervous 
Of handling his bate 
The pitchers hate to watch his eyes; 
They don't know where they are at. 
He stands there ready with the stick 
Upon the sphere to fall. 
And, Oh, the crowd lets out a yell 
When Mooney stings the ball! 
Yes, Mooney was designed by fate 
To make the pitchers mourn. 
The foxy inshoots and the wides 
He lets pass by with scorn. 
He stands regardless of the crowd, 
The strikes, the umpire's call, 
Until the sphere floats o'er the plateâ€” 
Then Mooney stings the ball!
