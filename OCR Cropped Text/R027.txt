When Does the Game start. 
A Detroit fan tells a story of a girl whom he took 
to see a game in that city. 
"She told me she knew all about the game, and 
when the players got on the field before the game 
to 'warm up,' she asked me what they were doing. 
I told her they were practicing. 
"The game started and she never uttered a word 
until about the seventh inning, when she leaned 
over to me and said:'say, Grover, when are they 
going to start the game?'"
