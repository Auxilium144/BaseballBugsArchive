	"Pug's" umpiring was good; 
No jeers carne from thc rooters, 
	No player him withstood. 
Then came the seventh inning

And "Pug" unto himself said, 
	"The time arrives to die!" 
McCarthy, of the home team, 
	The bison's twirler faced. 
The first ball pitched he clouted; 
	In vain the fielder chased.
McCarthy, made the circuit 
	While the joy-crazed multitude 
Yelled "Rah for Dan McCarthy! 
	We're one run to the good! 
But in that merry moment 
	The umpire raised his hand. 
A hush fell on the ball-field, 
	on bleacher, box and stand. 
"Hold on there!""Pug" spake loudly, 
	"D'ye think my eyes were shut? 
McCarthy's out! The first bag 
	By a full yard he cut!
