            athletes to either elevate the stage or raise the 
            standard of journalism to their own ground and lofty 
            standards, the authors of this book have presumed 
            to confiscate some of their laurels—aud two-bit 
            pieces, if we can get them—just to let the budding 
            thespians and embryo journalists realize that they 
            must expect legitimate competition in their respect- 
            ive lines of endeavor, and we hope that such stars as 
            Cristie, Tinker Joe, Muggsy, Jim, the Callahan, Mike, 
            and others yet to be heard from now on the diam- 
            ond, will not lead us too hard a race in the pursuit of 
            the aforementioned two-bits.

            pay our respects also to those doughty warriors who

            Chicago attorney, who tells this story of a Judge, a 
            brother lawyer and a state's attorney. 
            " When the last of the post season games was 
            being played an important case was before the court 
            " The defense and opposing state's attorney were 
            both rabid fans and wished to see the slugfest.

            continuance until the next day, 
            "When court convened in the afternoon, the de- 
            ence stepped to the bar and said: 
            "'May it please the court, I regret to have to ask 
            a continuance. A witness has been called away by 
            illness, and 1 do not see how I can proceed.' 
            "'What has the state to say?' said the judge. 
            "'While realizing the crowded condition of the 
            docket, and the court's valuable time, the state feels 
            it would be manifestly unfair to the defense to insist 
            on proceeding,' said the state's attorney.' I suggest 
            that the motion be favorably ruled on.' 
            "'Allright,' said the court. ' Wait until I get my 
            hat and i will go to the game with you.'"

            league is an ardent lecturer on temperance among

            rounds regarding the antics of an inebriated bats. 
            man is said to have originated with him. Here it is: 
            "A friend who had been celebrating, reported one 
            afternoon in such shape that he could barely walk 
            straight. When he went to bat he complained to 
            the umpire tha the saw three bats and three balls. 
            " Take the middle bat and hit the middle ball,' 
            he was advised. 
            He took three vigorous swings and was struck 
            out. 
            "'Why didn't you do as I suggested?' asked the 
            umpire. 
            "'I did,' said the player, 'but I hit with the out- 
            side of the bat, and that's why I missed.'"

            men do in factories or in other branches of labor, 
            according to an Eastern magnate. 
            Many ingenious excuses to obtain holidays have 
            been framed up, but we used to have a fellow who 
            wasn't satisfied with verbal excuses, but who actual- 
            ly disabled himself. He was expert at bunting, and 
            could judge a pitched ball so closely that he could 
            hit with any part of his bat. One day he was acci- 
            dentally hit on the index finger of his right hand, 
            the digit being crushed so that he was unfit for duty 
            for two weeks. Well, after that he used to smash a 
            finger regularly, varying the trick occasionally by 
            letting the ball hit his second finger. 
            "As a result of his conniving, he played only thir- 
            ty garnes that season, and drew full pay. He 
            became known as the champion hard luck' player."

            ball in a little Texas town called Hubbard City, and
            Shelton, a great kidder, was managing Temple, Tex.
            He wanted a pitcher and the S.L man told him of 
            the Boston guy. Shelton wired him and the kid came
            on the first train. Next day he was put in the box
            and the life hammered out of him, the opponents
            making nineteen hits in five innings. In that inning
            the Boston party asked Shelton what he thought of 
            his work. Shelton smiled, saying: "Young man, 
            you are doing splendid. They've not made a single
            off of you yet; although they have made a nineteen 
            hits- all doubles, triples and homers." Bean eater
