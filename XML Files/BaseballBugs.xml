                <p>It being now the fashion for our professional 
                    athletes to either elevate the stage or raise the 
                    standard of journalism to their own ground and lofty 
                    standards, the authors of this book have presumed 
                    to confiscate some of their laurels—aud two-bit 
                    pieces, if we can get them—just to let the budding 
                    thespians and embryo journalists realize that they 
                    must expect legitimate competition in their respect- 
                    ive lines of endeavor, and we hope that such stars as 
                    Cristie, Tinker Joe, Muggsy, Jim, the Callahan, Mike, 
                    and others yet to be heard from now on the diam- 
                    ond, will not lead us too hard a race in the pursuit of 
                    the aforementioned two-bits. </p>
                   <p> We should not feel that our duty had been ac- 
                    complished if we overlooked the roped arena, and 
                    pay our respects also to those doughty warriors who 
                    are now recognized as members of the pen pushers 
                    aggregation, viz. : the czar of Hegewisch, Ill., and

                <p>For years and in various parts of the country efforts 
                    have been made to have baseball declared a public 
                    nuisance. </p>
                <p> All of these efforts have failed, and others will 
                    meet with as little success, according to a well-known 
                    Chicago attorney, who tells this story of a Judge, a 
                    brother lawyer and a state's attorney. 
                    " When the last of the post season games was 
                    being played an important case was before the court 
                    " The defense and opposing state's attorney were 
                    both rabid fans and wished to see the slugfest.</p>

                    continuance until the next day, 
                    "When court convened in the afternoon, the de- 
                    ence stepped to the bar and said: 
                    "'May it please the court, I regret to have to ask 
                    a continuance. A witness has been called away by 
                    illness, and 1 do not see how I can proceed.' 
                    "'What has the state to say?' said the judge. 
                    "'While realizing the crowded condition of the 
                    docket, and the court's valuable time, the state feels 
                    it would be manifestly unfair to the defense to insist 
                    on proceeding,' said the state's attorney.' I suggest 
                    that the motion be favorably ruled on.' 
                    "'Allright,' said the court. ' Wait until I get my 
                    hat and i will go to the game with you.'"</p>

                    league is an ardent lecturer on temperance among 
                    his fellow-players. A story that has been going the

                    man is said to have originated with him. Here it is: 
                    "A friend who had been celebrating, reported one 
                    afternoon in such shape that he could barely walk 
                    straight. When he went to bat he complained to 
                    the umpire tha the saw three bats and three balls. 
                    " Take the middle bat and hit the middle ball,' 
                    he was advised. 
                    He took three vigorous swings and was struck 
                    out. 
                    "'Why didn't you do as I suggested?' asked the 
                    umpire. 
                    "'I did,' said the player, 'but I hit with the out- 
                    side of the bat, and that's why I missed.'"</p>

                <head>A Good Scheme.</head>
                <p>Some ball players shirk in their work just as lazy 
                    men do in factories or in other branches of labor, 
                    according to an Eastern magnate. 
                    Many ingenious excuses to obtain holidays have 
                    been framed up, but we used to have a fellow who 
                    wasn't satisfied with verbal excuses, but who actual- 
                    ly disabled himself. He was expert at bunting, and 
                    could judge a pitched ball so closely that he could 
                    hit with any part of his bat. One day he was acci- 
                    dentally hit on the index finger of his right hand, 
                    the digit being crushed so that he was unfit for duty 
                    for two weeks. Well, after that he used to smash a 
                    finger regularly, varying the trick occasionally by 
                    letting the ball hit his second finger. 
                    "As a result of his conniving, he played only thir- 
                    ty garnes that season, and drew full pay. He 
                    became known as the champion hard luck' player."</p>

                <p>A Detroit fan tells a story of a girl whom he took 
                    to see a game in that city. 
                    "She told me she knew all about the game, and 
                    when the players got on the field before the game 
                    to 'warm up,' she asked me what they were doing. 
                    I told her they were practicing. 
                    "The game started and she never uttered a word 
                    until about the seventh inning, when she leaned 
                    over to me and said:'say, Grover, when are they 
                    going to start the game?'"</p>

                <p>  A Southern League player tells a yarn on a mem-

                    "The beanerite at the time was playing amateur
                    ball in a little Texas town called Hubbard City, and
                    Shelton, a great kidder, was managing Temple, Tex.
                    He wanted a pitcher and the S.L man told him of 
                    the Boston guy. Shelton wired him and the kid came
                    on the first train. Next day he was put in the box
                    and the life hammered out of him, the opponents
                    making nineteen hits in five innings. In that inning
                    the Boston party asked Shelton what he thought of 
                    his work. Shelton smiled, saying: "Young man, 
                    you are doing splendid. They've not made a single
                    off of you yet; although they have made a nineteen 
                    hits- all doubles, triples and homers." Bean eater

                    League, and one of the most faithful as well as best
                    natured of "fans" on the continent, maintains a box
                    at the Washington ball park, for the purpose, one
                    might suppose, of inviting his friends to witness the
                    slaughter of the "Senators" by the various visiting
                    teams. Nick is notably fond of young people, and
                    has an appreciative eye for pretty girls, a bevy of 
                    whom always may be seen occupying the front
                    seats in his choicely located box. The young ladies
                    have to pay for this privilege, however, by listening
                    to the funny stories of the veteran, who by the
                    way, is old enough to be the grandfather of great
                    grandfather of most of them. Here is young's

                    in  the town of Greenville. You know i nver can
                    pass up a ball game, and when I learned that there
                    was a double-header on between Greenville and her
                    greatest rival, Spartanburg, why it was to me to the
                    park! Well the place was packed, and the only 
                    seats to be had were in the bleachers. that South
                    Carolina sun is a red hot brand, and during the</p>
                <pb n="43"/>
                <p>game a spectator toppled over with sunstroke. At 
                    the request of a physician a telegrapher at the park
                    ticked to the operator up town and asked him 
                    to send down the ambulance. Just a little while
                    after this excitement had passed two partisans of
                    the rival towns began mixing blows with their argu-
                    ments. The officer on duty yanked them out of
                    their seats and called to the operator: 
                    "Wire the chief to send out the patrol wagon!'"
                    "The obliging operator hustled the message over
                    the wire.
                    "'Sure!' ticked back the man. 'When do you
                    want the fire department?'"</p>

                    <l>Bill Sweeney was a backstop on the mooted Bug-</l>
                    <l>ville team:</l>
                    <l>At winging down to second base Bill Sweeney was</l>
                    <l>a dream; </l>
                    <l>The rooters used to swear by him, he their joy</l>

                    <l>Until he tried to emulate the famous "Kelley</l>

                    <l>For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base</l>
                    <l>and slide, </l>
                    <l>Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his </l>
                    <l>stride; </l>
                    <l>And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time</l>
                    <l>the rooters cried </l>
                    <l>They'd change the yell from Kelley and would</l>
                    <l>screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"</l>
                    <l>But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of</l>

                    <l>And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-</l>

                    <l>The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He </l>
                    <l>did?--Like Kelley did!" </l>
                    <l>For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-</l>

                    <l>And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle </l>

                <pb n="53"/>
                    <l>And when he'd start the fans would yelp together </l>
                    <l>as a man: </l>
                    <l>"O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like </l>
                    <l>Kelley can!" </l>
                    <l>Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem </l>
                    <l>to know </l>
                    <l>He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind </l>

                    <l>But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each </l>

                    <l>And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like</l>

                    <l>The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid </l>

                    <l>Bill opened with a double and was booted down to </l>
                    <l>third;</l>
                    <l>Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he</l>

                    <l>The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was</l>

                    <l>Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift</l>

                    <l>At last the time was come to act—immortalize his</l>

                    <l>He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like</l>

                    <l>And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,</l>
                    <l>Bill sprang from third! </l>
                    <l>"Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but</l>
                    <l>Sweeney never heard </l>

                <head>A Delicate Proposition.</head>
                <p>The manager of an asbestos mill in the west con- 
                    ceived a novel idea for New Year's announcements. 
                    He had them printed on thin asbestos and inclosed 
                    in envelopes of the same material. As he was un- 
                    certain of the correct addresses of some of the 
                    stockholders he ordered his stenographer to write 
                    on each envelope "Please forward." 
                    The idea was clever, but one may appreciate the 
                    feelings of the widow of one of the stockholders 
                    when she received an asbestos envelope addressed 
                    to her late husband, with the inscription "Please 
                    forward" beneath the address.</p>
