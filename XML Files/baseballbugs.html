            athletes to either elevate the stage or raise the 
            standard of journalism to their own ground and lofty 
            standards, the authors of this book have presumed 
            to confiscate some of their laurels—aud two-bit 
            pieces, if we can get them—just to let the budding 
            thespians and embryo journalists realize that they 
            must expect legitimate competition in their respect- 
            ive lines of endeavor, and we hope that such stars as 
            Cristie, Tinker Joe, Muggsy, Jim, the Callahan, Mike, 
            and others yet to be heard from now on the diam- 
            ond, will not lead us too hard a race in the pursuit of 
            the aforementioned two-bits.

            Chicago attorney, who tells this story of a Judge, a 
            brother lawyer and a state's attorney. 
            " When the last of the post season games was 
            being played an important case was before the court 
            " The defense and opposing state's attorney were 
            both rabid fans and wished to see the slugfest.

            continuance until the next day, 
            "When court convened in the afternoon, the de- 
            ence stepped to the bar and said: 
            "'May it please the court, I regret to have to ask 
            a continuance. A witness has been called away by 
            illness, and 1 do not see how I can proceed.' 
            "'What has the state to say?' said the judge. 
            "'While realizing the crowded condition of the 
            docket, and the court's valuable time, the state feels 
            it would be manifestly unfair to the defense to insist 
            on proceeding,' said the state's attorney.' I suggest 
            that the motion be favorably ruled on.' 
            "'Allright,' said the court. ' Wait until I get my 
            hat and i will go to the game with you.'"

            To wait, or not to wait,—that is the question:<br />
            Whether 'tis nobler in this game to suffer<br />
            The taunts and yells of the outrageous fans, <br />
            Or to dodge the curves and drops of an erratic <br />
            pitcher, <br />
            And, by my coolness 'scape them? To wait—to <br />
            walk,— <br />
            No more; and by a walk to say we stroll <br />
            To first, and then be daring like Ty Cobb, <br />
            And work the Double Steal,—'tis a consummation <br />
            Devoutly to be wished. To walk—to steal— <br />
            To steal. Perchance to score. Ay, there's the rub;— <br />
            For in that Double Steal what chance may come <br />
            When we have rattled the opposing pitcher, <br />
            Must give us runs; there's the respect <br />
            That makes a walk of so long life; <br />
            For who would bear the yells and taunts of fans, <br />
            The urnpire's wrong, the bleachers' contumely, <br />
            "The pangs of disprized hope, the games delay, <br />
            The insolence of gamins, and the spurns <br />
            That one must take from the unknowing <br />
            When he himself his fame might make<br />

            By a 2-bagger? Who would roastings bear, <br />
            To grunt and swear under a weary game, <br />
            But that the dread of somethiug after it, <br />
            The Minor Leagues, from whose ranks <br />
            No old time star returns, startles the mind;- <br />
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br />
            Than fly to others whence we ne'er return? <br />
            These bleachers do make cowards of us all; <br />
            And thus the fumble of a hard-hit grounder, <br />
            Is yelled at by the bleacher mob, <br />
            And, thus in places of great chance and moment, <br />
            We all make bone-head plays that lose the game.<br />

         <div style="text-align: center;">
            
            No wonder that "Pug" Dugan<br />
            Wore a perpetual scowl,<br />
            No wonder that unto him<br />
            Life's skies seemed ever foul!<br />
            For "Pug" a "has-been" pitcher,<br />
            Now held an umpire's job,<br />
            And heard himself called daily:<br />
            "Rube,""robber,""soak" and "slob"<br />
            "Pug" brooded o'er his troubles,<br />
            The scowling, howling fans, <br />
            The bickering, blustering players,<br />
            The captains with their "damns!"<br />
            He swore that he no longer<br />
            His troubles would endure,<br />
            And planned a way to end them<br />
            That would be swift and sure!<br />
            That day, the Wolves, the home team,<br /> 
            The Bisons were to play.<br />
            The whole of Wolfburg journeyed<br />
            To see their heroes play.<br />
            The Bisons led the leagues now,<br /> 
            But the Wolves held second place,<br />
            And if they beat the Bisons<br />
            The wolves would lead the race.<br />
            <br />
            hrough six exciting innings <br />
            "Pug's" umpiring was good; <br />
            No jeers carne from thc rooters,<br />
            No player him withstood. <br />
            Then came the seventh inning <br />
            (The fierce game still a tie), <br />
            And "Pug" unto himself said, <br />
            "The time arrives to die!" <br /></div>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            McCarthy, of the home team, <br />
             The bison's twirler faced. <br />
            The first ball pitched he clouted;<br /> 
             In vain the fielder chased.<br />
            McCarthy, made the circuit <br />
            While the joy-crazed multitude <br />
            Yelled "Rah for Dan McCarthy! <br />
            We're one run to the good! <br /></div>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            But in that merry moment <br />
            The umpire raised his hand. <br />
            A hush fell on the ball-field, <br />
            on bleacher, box and stand. <br />
            "Hold on there!""Pug" spake loudly,<br /> 
            "D'ye think my eyes were shut? <br />
            McCarthy's out! The first bag <br />
            By a full yard he cut!<br /></div>
         <br />
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            The bleachers gave a war-whoop!<br />
            The grandstand joined its roar!<br />
            The scribes within the press-box,<br />
            Bawled loudly for "Pug's" gore!<br />
            But ere their was wrath vented,<br />
            McCarthy grabbed the bat <br />
            That knocked that honest homer,<br />
            And laid the umpire flat. <br />
            Up rushed the other Wolves then, <br />
            Their heels in him they dug, <br />
            And the punches they rained on him <br />
            Made jelly out of "Pug!" <br />
            Up came the maddened rooters, <br />
            A fierce, blood-thirsty swarm, <br />
            They made the umpire shapeless <br />
            By stamping on his form ! <br />
            Cried police, judges, preacher: <br />
            "Leave not a shred of him!" <br />
            Save Bisonburg, the land cried:<br />
            "He earned it! Devil's limb!" <br />
            They buried "Pug," unprayed-for, <br />
            In marshy, worthless land, <br />
            And no one ever dreamed that he <br />
            Just such a death had planned, <br />

            "A friend who had been celebrating, reported one 
            afternoon in such shape that he could barely walk 
            straight. When he went to bat he complained to 
            the umpire tha the saw three bats and three balls. 
            " Take the middle bat and hit the middle ball,' 
            he was advised. 
            He took three vigorous swings and was struck 
            out. 
            "'Why didn't you do as I suggested?' asked the 
            umpire. 
            "'I did,' said the player, 'but I hit with the out- 
            side of the bat, and that's why I missed.'"

            men do in factories or in other branches of labor, 
            according to an Eastern magnate. 
            Many ingenious excuses to obtain holidays have 
            been framed up, but we used to have a fellow who 
            wasn't satisfied with verbal excuses, but who actual- 
            ly disabled himself. He was expert at bunting, and 
            could judge a pitched ball so closely that he could 
            hit with any part of his bat. One day he was acci- 
            dentally hit on the index finger of his right hand, 
            the digit being crushed so that he was unfit for duty 
            for two weeks. Well, after that he used to smash a 
            finger regularly, varying the trick occasionally by 
            letting the ball hit his second finger. 
            "As a result of his conniving, he played only thir- 
            ty garnes that season, and drew full pay. He 
            became known as the champion hard luck' player."

            "The beanerite at the time was playing amateur
            ball in a little Texas town called Hubbard City, and
            Shelton, a great kidder, was managing Temple, Tex.
            He wanted a pitcher and the S.L man told him of 
            the Boston guy. Shelton wired him and the kid came
            on the first train. Next day he was put in the box
            and the life hammered out of him, the opponents
            making nineteen hits in five innings. In that inning
            the Boston party asked Shelton what he thought of 
            his work. Shelton smiled, saying: "Young man, 
            you are doing splendid. They've not made a single
            off of you yet; although they have made a nineteen 
            hits- all doubles, triples and homers." Bean eater

            slide." <br />
            For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base<br />
            and slide, <br />
            Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his <br />
            stride; <br />
            And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time<br />
            the rooters cried <br />
            They'd change the yell from Kelley and would<br />
            screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"<br />
            But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of<br />
            speed, <br />
            While Sweeney had a cracking whip but great <br />
            speed seemed to need; <br />
            And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-<br />
            ible, and slid. <br />
            The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He <br />
            did?--Like Kelley did!" <br />
            For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-<br />
            ed a bag,<br />
            And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle <br />
            up and lag;<br />
            <br />
            And when he'd start the fans would yelp together <br />
            as a man: <br />
            "O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like <br />
            Kelley can!" <br />
            Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem <br />
            to know <br />
            He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind <br />
            of throw. <br />
            But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each <br />
            time he slid,<br />
            And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like<br />
            Kelley did! <br />
            The ninth round came; the visitors had tied the <br />
            single score;<br />
            The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid <br />
            a roar.<br />
            Bill opened with a double and was booted down to <br />
            third;<br />
            Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he<br />
            ever heard.<br />
            The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was<br />
            held on third.<br />
            Up stepped the heavy sticker of the team, a clout-<br />
            in bird.<br />
            But while Bill pawed the ground at third, out yelled<br />
            a zealous fan:<br />
            "O, Bill can steal home base and win! He can?<br />
            Like Kelley can!"<br />
            <br />
            Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift<br />
            and livid flame!<br />
            At last the time was come to act—immortalize his<br />
            name!<br />
            His daily practice had improved his speed—he'd<br />
            sure make good! <br />
            He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like<br />
            Kelley could! <br />
            And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,<br />
            Bill sprang from third! <br />
            "Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but<br />
            Sweeney never heard <br />
            A hush fell on the multitude—a silence deep, pro- <br />
            found, <br />
            While Bill dived to the earth and plowed up twenty <br />
            feet of ground. <br />
            In Bugville's potter's field to-day there is a little<br />
            plot, <br />
            And o'er it stands a painted board which marks <br />
            Bill's resting spot; <br />
            And those who run may read these words: "At <br />
            last the fans are rid <br />
            of Sweeney, who stole home and Won! He did?<br />
            —Like Kelley did!"<br /></div>

            insisted that after a lit-

            Young Lochinvar came out of the brush, <br />
            He came with a yell, he came with a rush; <br />
            He'd a "curve like a pretzel," and '"marvelous <br />
            speed," <br />
            "A perfect control"—he was "up in tile lead." <br />
            He "batted .300;" he "lined 'em out far"-- <br />

            In pratice he made the big leaguers fan air, <br />
            In batting and fielding he surely was there. <br />
            His name in the papers appeared every day, <br />
            And the fans almost wept when we farmed him <br />
            away, <br />

            Is a motorman on a surface line car. <br />

            When Murphy bunts, and gets to first, <br />
            We cheer his feat with pride; <br />
            The ball twists slowly down the line, <br />
            And never rolls outside. <br />
            When Casey makes a sacrifice, <br />
            His deftness moves us all, <br />
            But, Oh, the real hi-hi-ing comes <br />

            For Mooney has a nervous way<br />
            Of handling his bat.<br />
            The pitchers hate to watch his eyes; <br />
            They don't know where they are at. <br />
            He stands there ready with the stick <br />
            Upon the sphere to fall. <br />
            And, oh, the crowd lets out a yell <br />
            When Mooney stings the ball! <br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            Yes, Mooney was designed by fate <br />
            To make the pitchers mourn. <br />
            The foxy inshoots and the wides <br />
            He lets pass by with scorn. <br />
            He stands regardless of the crowd, <br />
            The strikes, the umpire's call, <br />
            Until the sphere floats o'er the plate— <br />
            Then Mooney stings the ball!<br /></div>

         <div style="text-align: center;">
            It moves us when the center field <br />
            Pulls fdown the fly he's cursed,<br />
            It thrills us when the shortstop's throw <br />
            Cuts off a man at first, <br />
            But, oh, the fierce excitemet when, <br />
            The bases filled, we all <br />
            Leap up and howl, and dance, and yell, <br />

            the opening of the season's games, some well be- 
            loved member of his family must give up the ghost. 
            Hank is in a quandary to know whether it shall be 
            Grandma, Uncle, Granpa, Aunt, Papa or mamma, but 
            finally decides to cinch the argument, that he will
            make himself a half orphan that day by telling
            teacher, that papa died.  Result; Hank sees game.

            certain of the correct addresses of some of the 
            stockholders he ordered his stenographer to write 
            on each envelope "Please forward."
