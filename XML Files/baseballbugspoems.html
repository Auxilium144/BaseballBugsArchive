               The Batter's Soliloquy. <br />
               DONALD DOUGLASS <br />
               Ninth Inning, man on third, two gone, and score 2-2.<br />

            To wait, or not to wait,—that is the question:<br />
            Whether 'tis nobler in this game to suffer<br />
            The taunts and yells of the outrageous fans, <br />
            Or to dodge the curves and drops of an erratic <br />
            pitcher, <br />
            And, by my coolness 'scape them? To wait—to <br />
            walk,— <br />
            No more; and by a walk to say we stroll <br />
            To first, and then be daring like Ty Cobb, <br />
            And work the Double Steal,—'tis a consummation <br />
            Devoutly to be wished. To walk—to steal— <br />
            To steal. Perchance to score. Ay, there's the rub;— <br />
            For in that Double Steal what chance may come <br />
            When we have rattled the opposing pitcher, <br />
            Must give us runs; there's the respect <br />
            That makes a walk of so long life; <br />
            For who would bear the yells and taunts of fans, <br />
            The urnpire's wrong, the bleachers' contumely, <br />
            "The pangs of disprized hope, the games delay, <br />
            The insolence of gamins, and the spurns <br />
            That one must take from the unknowing <br />
            When he himself his fame might make<br />

            By a 2-bagger? Who would roastings bear, <br />
            To grunt and swear under a weary game, <br />
            But that the dread of somethiug after it, <br />
            The Minor Leagues, from whose ranks <br />
            No old time star returns, startles the mind;- <br />
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br />
            Than fly to others whence we ne'er return? <br />
            These bleachers do make cowards of us all; <br />
            And thus the fumble of a hard-hit grounder, <br />
            Is yelled at by the bleacher mob, <br />
            And, thus in places of great chance and moment, <br />
            We all make bone-head plays that lose the game.<br />

            <p><strong>Title: </strong>Why "Pug" Dugan called McCarty Out.

         <div style="text-align: center;">
            
            No wonder that "Pug" Dugan<br />
            Wore a perpetual scowl,<br />
            No wonder that unto him<br />
            Life's skies seemed ever foul!<br />
            For "Pug" a "has-been" pitcher,<br />
            Now held an umpire's job,<br />
            And heard himself called daily:<br />
            "Rube,""robber,""soak" and "slob"<br />
            "Pug" brooded o'er his troubles,<br />
            The scowling, howling fans, <br />
            The bickering, blustering players,<br />
            The captains with their "damns!"<br />
            He swore that he no longer<br />
            His troubles would endure,<br />
            And planned a way to end them<br />
            That would be swift and sure!<br />
            That day, the Wolves, the home team,<br /> 
            The Bisons were to play.<br />
            The whole of Wolfburg journeyed<br />
            To see their heroes play.<br />
            The Bisons led the leagues now,<br /> 
            But the Wolves held second place,<br />
            And if they beat the Bisons<br />
            The wolves would lead the race.<br />
            <br />
            hrough six exciting innings <br />
            "Pug's" umpiring was good; <br />
            No jeers carne from thc rooters,<br />
            No player him withstood. <br />
            Then came the seventh inning <br />
            (The fierce game still a tie), <br />
            And "Pug" unto himself said, <br />
            "The time arrives to die!" <br /></div>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            McCarthy, of the home team, <br />
             The bison's twirler faced. <br />
            The first ball pitched he clouted;<br /> 
             In vain the fielder chased.<br />
            McCarthy, made the circuit <br />
            While the joy-crazed multitude <br />
            Yelled "Rah for Dan McCarthy! <br />
            We're one run to the good! <br /></div>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            But in that merry moment <br />
            The umpire raised his hand. <br />
            A hush fell on the ball-field, <br />
            on bleacher, box and stand. <br />
            "Hold on there!""Pug" spake loudly,<br /> 
            "D'ye think my eyes were shut? <br />
            McCarthy's out! The first bag <br />
            By a full yard he cut!<br /></div>
         <br />
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            The bleachers gave a war-whoop!<br />
            The grandstand joined its roar!<br />
            The scribes within the press-box,<br />
            Bawled loudly for "Pug's" gore!<br />
            But ere their was wrath vented,<br />
            McCarthy grabbed the bat <br />
            That knocked that honest homer,<br />
            And laid the umpire flat. <br />
            Up rushed the other Wolves then, <br />
            Their heels in him they dug, <br />
            And the punches they rained on him <br />
            Made jelly out of "Pug!" <br />
            Up came the maddened rooters, <br />
            A fierce, blood-thirsty swarm, <br />
            They made the umpire shapeless <br />
            By stamping on his form ! <br />
            Cried police, judges, preacher: <br />
            "Leave not a shred of him!" <br />
            Save Bisonburg, the land cried:<br />
            "He earned it! Devil's limb!" <br />
            They buried "Pug," unprayed-for, <br />
            In marshy, worthless land, <br />
            And no one ever dreamed that he <br />
            Just such a death had planned, <br />

            The honey of spring was in the air<br />
            The day was one for joy,<br />
            But he sat at his desk and didn't care<br />
            And he growled at the office boy.<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            He nursed a big grouch--the world looked dark-<br />
            He only grumbled and frowned; <br />
            He grabbed his hat and went to the park <br />
            To see the home team downed.<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            For eight innings he sat—not a feeling of pride, <br />
            Though the game was close and fast;— <br />
            He looked for defeat, though the game was tied <br />
            When they took the field for the last.<br /></div>

             Three men got on bases, chances looked slim,<br />
            A score seemed as sure as fate.<br />
            He muttered a prayer, and his smile was grim <br />
            As the batter strode to the plate.<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
             The pitcher gazed, his arm held high, <br />
            And smiling, tossed his head. <br />
            The batter swung-the rooters sighted <br />
            As the ball for the outfield sped.<br /></div>
         <br />
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            But into the air like a bolt from a gun<br />
            Went the shortstop and saved the day.<br />
            His eye was true- and there was no run,<br />
            For he pulled off a triple play.<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
             The man with the grouch jumped up on his feet <br />
            And hurled his hat at the sun, <br />
            And hc whooped and roared and stamped his feet <br />
            When the home boys made a run.<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
             Happy and glad he went on his way <br />

            And his happiness lasted for many a day,— <br />

            And often erratic; <br />
            The alienists say he has dust in his attic. <br />
            But brush him a bit and proceedings he stops— <br />

            Willie was an office boy,<br />
            Willie was a fan;<br />
            Willie knew more about baseball<br />
            Than many an older man.<br />
            Wille said his brother<br />
            Was sick as a man could be,<br />

            And Willie's look as he stood there<br />
             Was totally free from guile.<br />
             His head bowed low with sorrow,<br />
             He slowly went outside,<br />
             While gloom hung over the office,<br />

            "Not on your life," said Willie, <br />
            Forgetting himself in his rage, <br />
             Which was rather improper of Willie, <br />
            Considering he wasn't of age, <br /></div>
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            "Oh, tell me, Willie, tell me," <br />
            The gentle Boss then cried; <br />
            "Your brother—is he safe at home ? <br />
            Or has the poor chap died ? " <br />
            "I should say he wasn't safe at home <br />

            Bill Sweeney was a backstop on the mooted Bug-<br />
            ville team:<br />
            At winging down to second base Bill Sweeney was<br />
            a dream; <br />
            The rooters used to swear by him, he their joy<br />
            and pride,<br />
            Until he tried to emulate the famous "Kelley<br />
            slide." <br />
            For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base<br />
            and slide, <br />
            Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his <br />
            stride; <br />
            And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time<br />
            the rooters cried <br />
            They'd change the yell from Kelley and would<br />
            screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"<br />
            But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of<br />
            speed, <br />
            While Sweeney had a cracking whip but great <br />
            speed seemed to need; <br />
            And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-<br />
            ible, and slid. <br />
            The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He <br />
            did?--Like Kelley did!" <br />
            For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-<br />
            ed a bag,<br />
            And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle <br />
            up and lag;<br />
            <br />
            And when he'd start the fans would yelp together <br />
            as a man: <br />
            "O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like <br />
            Kelley can!" <br />
            Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem <br />
            to know <br />
            He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind <br />
            of throw. <br />
            But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each <br />
            time he slid,<br />
            And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like<br />
            Kelley did! <br />
            The ninth round came; the visitors had tied the <br />
            single score;<br />
            The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid <br />
            a roar.<br />
            Bill opened with a double and was booted down to <br />
            third;<br />
            Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he<br />
            ever heard.<br />
            The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was<br />
            held on third.<br />
            Up stepped the heavy sticker of the team, a clout-<br />
            in bird.<br />
            But while Bill pawed the ground at third, out yelled<br />
            a zealous fan:<br />
            "O, Bill can steal home base and win! He can?<br />
            Like Kelley can!"<br />
            <br />
            Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift<br />
            and livid flame!<br />
            At last the time was come to act—immortalize his<br />
            name!<br />
            His daily practice had improved his speed—he'd<br />
            sure make good! <br />
            He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like<br />
            Kelley could! <br />
            And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,<br />
            Bill sprang from third! <br />
            "Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but<br />
            Sweeney never heard <br />
            A hush fell on the multitude—a silence deep, pro- <br />
            found, <br />
            While Bill dived to the earth and plowed up twenty <br />
            feet of ground. <br />
            In Bugville's potter's field to-day there is a little<br />
            plot, <br />
            And o'er it stands a painted board which marks <br />
            Bill's resting spot; <br />
            And those who run may read these words: "At <br />
            last the fans are rid <br />
            of Sweeney, who stole home and Won! He did?<br />

            In batting and fielding he surely was there. <br />
            His name in the papers appeared every day, <br />
            And the fans almost wept when we farmed him <br />
            away, <br />

            sales,<br />

            Once more throughout the land resounds<br />
            A bunch of sweet, familiar sounds, <br />
            As though without the last excuse<br />
            The college children had broke loose. <br />
            The racket is not that at all;<br />
            It's just the ancient cry,<br />
            Play ball! <br /></div>

            When winter quits us on a strike <br />
            And gentle spring comes down the pike,<br /> 
            Then something stirs the youthful breast<br /> 
            Beneath its soiled, but manly vest. <br />
            That something is the earnest call <br />
            From every husky throat, <br />
            Play ball!<br /></div>

            No; it was not a railroad wreck <br />

            Who is it that wins all the praise,<br /> 
            Receives the burden of the day's<br />
            Applause? And has a friend who pays<br />
            For whate'er roughhouse he may raise?<br />
            THE SLUGGER.<br />
            Who makes us howl with ecstasy, <br />
            Who makes us yowl with fervent glee, <br />
            Who gets a hand each time that he <br />
            Strides to the plate with motion free? <br />
            THE SLUGGER. <br />
            Who is it that with score a tie, <br />
            With bases full and feeling high, <br />
            Can let a perfect strike go by <br />
            And not expect at once to die? <br />
            THE SLUGGER. <br />
            Ball Players the people all adore <br />
            And heroes who have gone before: <br />
            All sorts of bigwigs, by the score. <br />
            But there is one whom they love more, <br />
            THE SLUGGER.<br /></div>

         <div style="text-align: center;">
            When Murphy bunts, and gets to first, <br />
            We cheer his feat with pride; <br />
            The ball twists slowly down the line, <br />
            And never rolls outside. <br />
            When Casey makes a sacrifice, <br />
            His deftness moves us all, <br />
            But, Oh, the real hi-hi-ing comes <br />
            When Mooney stings the ball!<br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            For Mooney has a nervous way<br />
            Of handling his bat.<br />
            The pitchers hate to watch his eyes; <br />
            They don't know where they are at. <br />
            He stands there ready with the stick <br />
            Upon the sphere to fall. <br />
            And, oh, the crowd lets out a yell <br />
            When Mooney stings the ball! <br /></div>
         
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            Yes, Mooney was designed by fate <br />
            To make the pitchers mourn. <br />
            The foxy inshoots and the wides <br />
            He lets pass by with scorn. <br />
            He stands regardless of the crowd, <br />
            The strikes, the umpire's call, <br />
            Until the sphere floats o'er the plate— <br />
            Then Mooney stings the ball!<br /></div>
         <br />
         
         <div style="text-align: center;">
            It moves us when the center field <br />
            Pulls fdown the fly he's cursed,<br />
            It thrills us when the shortstop's throw <br />
            Cuts off a man at first, <br />
            But, oh, the fierce excitemet when, <br />
            The bases filled, we all <br />
            Leap up and howl, and dance, and yell, <br />
            When Mooney stings the ball!<br /></div>
