        <p>Editorial Note: <br/><br/>
            This project began as a preservation effort from within the Special Editions Collection at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln archive.  
            <br/>Our efforts in finding information about this book resulted in minimal results and thus it was decided that this book could benefit 
            <br/>from a digital archive in order to preserve its contents.  The project involved three main phases, the capturing of page images from 
            <br/>the book, the translation of those images into a digital text in which we utilized optical character recognition software as well as 
            <br/>manual transcription, and finally the digital archiving phase where the transcribed material was formatted into an xml file.  Our xml 
            <br/>file focused mainly distinguishing the main elements of the book from each other.  As the book does not have a cohesive narrative, the 
            <br/>organization of the material was a difficult process both to read and to archive.  As a result of this, we have decided to include the 
            <br/>full in order archive as well as three individual pages which show only the jokes, poems, or comics present within the book.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As you peruse the archive, individual poems will be denoted with a blue border, comics will be denoted with a green border, and the individual 
            <br/>jokes will be denoted with an orange border.  This is done to help the reader visual how each whole section.  The decision to encapsulate 
            <br/>each individual joke, poem, and comic improves upon the original publishing as throughout the book there are often page breaks present 
            <br/>which causes the reader much confusion as to where individual elements begin and end.  
            <br/>
            <br/>The content of the book offers a wide range of humor from the early 20th century.  There are poems dealing with thrill of the crowd as 
            <br/>a base is stolen, and funny one-liners about the virtues of ball park food.  Regardless of oneâ€™s tastes, there is something for everyone 
            <br/>to enjoy in this archive.  We here at the Baseball Bugs team hope you enjoy the archive.  
            <br/>
            <br/>Thank You and Play Ball!
