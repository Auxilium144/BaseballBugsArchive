***Poem
And we Played Ball.
Once more throughout the land resounds
A bunch of sweet, familiar sounds, 
As though without the last excuse
The college children had broke loose. 
The racket is not that at all;
It's just the ancient cry,
Play ball! 

When winter quits us on a strike 
And gentle spring comes down the pike, 
Then something stirs the youthful breast 
Beneath its soiled, but manly vest. 
That something is the earnest call 
From every husky throat, 
Play ball!

Why is it "Bugs?" 
Bugs Raymond had been promised $1,000 for 
keeping on the water wagon. 
If Mr. Raymond hadn't acquired the nickname of 
"Bugs" would any astute manager offer him $1,000 
for keeping on the water wagon?

As ve churney tro' life, let us choke by the vay.
