And when he'd start the fans would yelp together 
as a man: 
"O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like 
Kelley can!" 
Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem 
to know 
He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind 
of throw. 
But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each 
time he slid,
And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like
Kelley did! 
The ninth round came; the visitors had tied the 
single score;
The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid 
a roar.
Bill opened with a double and was booted down to 
third;
Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he
ever heard.
The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was
held on third.
Up stepped the heavy sticker of the team, a clout-
in bird.
But while Bill pawed the ground at third, out yelled
a zealous fan:
"O, Bill can steal home base and win! He can?
Like Kelley can!"
