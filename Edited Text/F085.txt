Strike! One.

Existence is like a ball game, for when we come 
to figure it out we get these results. It's a scramble 
for a look-in, and when in a scrap to hold our own. 
We have a grouch against the other side which can 
only be wiped out by their gore.  Should a decision 
be rendered against us, all opponents are wolves and 
should not have a license to breathe.  If things are 
rosy, we'congratulate ourselves on the knowledge 
we think we possess.
