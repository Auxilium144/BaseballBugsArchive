Get on to the Phenom. 
Young Lochinvar came out of the brush, 
He came with a yell, he came with a rush; 
He'd a "curve like a pretzel," and '"marvelous 
speed," 
"A perfect control"—he was "up in tile lead." 
He "batted .300;" he "lined 'em out far"-- 
Oh, he was some player, was young Lochinvar,
 
In pratice he made the big leaguers fan air, 
In batting and fielding he surely was there. 
His name in the papers appeared every day, 
And the fans almost wept when we farmed him 
away, 
That was only last year—now Lochinvar 
Is a motorman on a surface line car. 
But so long as in players there transfers and 
sales,
The annual crop of "phenoms" never fails.
