A Vain Hope.
A ball player who be- 
tween times defends di-
vorce suits, had a finger 
badly hurt when he was
new at the game, and a
doctor was called in to 
attend to it. The sur- 
geon was cheerful, and 
insisted that after a lit- 
tle rest the finger would 
be as good as ever. 
"Sure of that?" said 
the b. p. 
"Sure as can be," said 
the doc. 
"Will I be able to play 
the piano?"
"Certainly."
"I'm mighty glad of that," answered the twirler, 
"I have tried to play it for ten years, and haven't 
struck a tune yet."
