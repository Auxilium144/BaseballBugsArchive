Ye Ancienct Manageer. 
The baseball Fan sat on a stone, 
He could not choose but hear,
And then spake on that hopeful man— 
The Bright-Eyed Manageer.

"Although it's early, it would seem," 
The modest manager will say, 
"We have the very finest team 
The diamond's seen in many a day. 
Yes, I am feeling pretty gay, 
And you can take my little steer 
That we will put 'em all away— 
We ought to get the flag this year.
 
"Our staff of pitchers is supreme; 
Our catcher is a veteran gray; 
Our fielders are the very cream— 
The finest in the U. S. A. 
We'll take the lead in early May 
And keep it till the end is here; 
We'll get in front and there we'll stay— 
We ought to get the flag this year.

"Yes, you can bet your last centime
