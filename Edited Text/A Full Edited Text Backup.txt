Ye Ancienct Manageer. 
The baseball Fan sat on a stone, 
He could not choose but hear,
And then spake on that hopeful man— 
The Bright-Eyed Manageer.

"Although it's early, it would seem," 
The modest manager will say, 
"We have the very finest team 
The diamond's seen in many a day. 
Yes, I am feeling pretty gay, 
And you can take my little steer 
That we will put 'em all away— 
We ought to get the flag this year.
 
"Our staff of pitchers is supreme; 
Our catcher is a veteran gray; 
Our fielders are the very cream— 
The finest in the U. S. A. 
We'll take the lead in early May 
And keep it till the end is here; 
We'll get in front and there we'll stay— 
We ought to get the flag this year.

"Yes, you can bet your last centime
The rest'll know there's been a fray

****** Result for Image/Page 47 ******
When we get through, and that's no dream.
Why, if you'd seen those fellows play
In practice you'd just yell 'Hooray!' 
That pennant's on the chandelier—— 
The rest we simply overlay— 
We ought to get the flag this year."

Like Kellie Did 
Bill Sweeney was a backstop on the mooted Bug-
ville team:
At winging down to second base Bill Sweeney was
a dream; 
The rooters used to swear by him, he their joy
and pride,
Until he tried to emulate the famous "Kelley
slide." 
For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base
and slide, 
Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his 
stride; 
And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time
the rooters cried 
They'd change the yell from Kelley and would
screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"
But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of
speed, 
While Sweeney had a cracking whip but great 
speed seemed to need; 
And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-
ible, and slid. 
The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He 
did?--Like Kelley did!" 
For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-
ed a bag,
And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle 
up and lag; 


****** Result for Image/Page 53 ******
And when he'd start the fans would yelp together 
as a man: 
"O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like 
Kelley can!" 
Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem 
to know 
He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind 
of throw. 
But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each 
time he slid,
And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like
Kelley did! 
The ninth round came; the visitors had tied the 
single score;
The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid 
a roar.
Bill opened with a double and was booted down to 
third;
Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he
ever heard.
The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was
held on third.
Up stepped the heavy sticker of the team, a clout-
in bird.
But while Bill pawed the ground at third, out yelled
a zealous fan:
"O, Bill can steal home base and win! He can?
Like Kelley can!"


****** Result for Image/Page 54 ******
Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift
and livid flame!
At last the time was come to act—immortalize his
name!
His daily practice had improved his speed—he'd
sure make good! 
He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like
Kelley could! 
And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,
Bill sprang from third! 
"Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but
Sweeney never heard 
A hush fell on the multitude—a silence deep, pro- 
found, 
While Bill dived to the earth and plowed up twenty 
feet of ground. 
In Bugville's potter's field to-day there is a little
plot, 
And o'er it stands a painted board which marks 
Bill's resting spot; 
And those who run may read these words: "At 
last the fans are rid 
of Sweeney, who stole home and Won! He did?
—Like Kelley did!"

In batting and fielding he surely was there.

And the fans almost wept when we farmed him

With bases full and feeling high, 
Can let a perfect strike go by 
And not expect at once to die?

Among the other delights of the busy baseball 
season, is a cessation of novel-writing by the stars 
of the diamond.

A student at a technical school in Boston, who 
had too frequently asked leave of abscence, offered
on one occasion as a reason for attending the ball 
game, the necessity of going to the funeral of his
cousin.
"Well," said the doubting instructor, "I suppose
I must let you go, but I do wish it were a nearer 
relative."

"Never make a fuss about what you can't help," 
said the homely philosopher. 
"Nonsense," replied the fan.  "That idea would 
take half the excitement out of a baseball game."

He showed his ignorance. 
Freshley--"In the class this morning the professor 
of English literature said something about Beau- 
mont and Fletcher.  I know who Beaumont is, of 
course; he's the new outfielder for the Cubs.  But 
who the Sam Hill is Fletcher?" 
The other bug—"Why, you bonehead, he's the

Existence is like a ball game, for when we come 
to figure it out we get these results. It's a scramble 
for a look-in, and when in a scrap to hold our own. 
We have a grouch against the other side which can 
only be wiped out by their gore.  Should a decision 
be rendered against us, all opponents are wolves and 
should not have a license to breathe.  If things are 
rosy, we'congratulate ourselves on the knowledge 
we think we possess.

They are all GOING to lift it. 
When the baseball season opens, the uninitiated 
mortal who takes pleasure in looking over the pub- 
licity colums dubbed "sporting editions," at the 
beginning of the season's games, would imagine 
there was a pennant for each club.

It is the fashion in all well-ordered burgs to have 
what is known as a "Rialto" for the exploitation of 
our favorite matinee idols.  Why not have a street 
known as the "Diamond," where our stars from the
field can also pose and make goo-goo eyes, they can
do it as well as the hams.

This will paralyze him. 
When the boss asks you why you want the after- 
noon off just tell him that you want to go to the 
ball game.  He will probably be so startled at your 
frankness that the desired permission will be forth- 
coming before he recovers.

The one absorbing topic
Have you heard about the scandal 
That involvess a statesman great? 
And a banker and a minister, 
And the ruler of a state? 
They tell me——let me whisper——"

I wonder can you tell me 
Who's in the box today?
 
There's another big strike threatened, 
'Twill bring on a bitter strife, 
And the trusts have got a corner 
On the necessities of life.

And tell me, what's the score?

The six best sellers. 
Can you name the six best sellers? The book 
publishers are falling over one another to get the 
dope that is being given a fanable public by the so- 
called scribeologists who during summer time work 
on the diamond, but during loafing spells have vis- 
ions of greatness being thrust upon them through the 
medium of the professional story writer. And the 
funny part is that the f. p. stand for the game from 
their ball playing heroes.
