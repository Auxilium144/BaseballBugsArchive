APOLOGY 
*GRAPHIC*
It being now the fashion for our professional 
athletes to either elevate the stage or raise the 
standard of journalism to their own ground and lofty 
standards, the authors of this book have presumed 
to confiscate some of their laurels—aud two-bit 
pieces, if we can get them—just to let the budding 
thespians and embryo journalists realize that they 
must expect legitimate competition in their respect- 
ive lines of endeavor, and we hope that such stars as 
Cristie, Tinker Joe, Muggsy, Jim, the Callahan, Mike, 
and others yet to be heard from now on the diam- 
ond, will not lead us too hard a race in the pursuit of 
the aforementioned two-bits. 
We should not feel that our duty had been ac- 
complished if we overlooked the roped arena, and 
pay our respects also to those doughty warriors who 
are now recognized as members of the pen pushers 
aggregation, viz. : the czar of Hegewisch, Ill., and 
the peerless J. J. J. Now get ready to smile.

A Shirt Front Protector. 
"Charlie, dear," asked the fair maid at the ball 
park, " why does that man behind the hitter wear 
such a big bib? " 
" That," explained Charles, " is to keep his shirt- 
front from being mussed when the ball knocks out 
his front teeth."

The Judge was on. 
For years and in various parts of the country efforts 
have been made to have baseball declared a public 
nuisance. 
All of these efforts have failed, and others will 
meet with as little success, according to a well-known 
Chicago attorney, who tells this story of a Judge, a 
brother lawyer and a state's attorney. 
" When the last of the post season games was 
being played an important case was before the court 
" The defense and opposing state's attorney were 
both rabid fans and wished to see the slugfest. 
****** Result for Image/Page 8 ******
"During the noon recess it was agreed to ask for 
continuance until the next day, 
"When court convened in the afternoon, the de- 
ence stepped to the bar and said: 
"'May it please the court, I regret to have to ask 
a continuance. A witness has been called away by 
illness, and 1 do not see how I can proceed.' 
"'What has the state to say?' said the judge. 
"'While realizing the crowded condition of the 
docket, and the court's valuable time, the state feels 
it would be manifestly unfair to the defense to insist 
on proceeding,' said the state's attorney.' I suggest 
that the motion be favorably ruled on.' 
"'Allright,' said the court. ' Wait until I get my 
hat and i will go to the game with you.'"

DONALD DOUGLASS 
Ninth Inning, man on third, two gone, and the score 2-2.
To wait, or not to wait,—that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in this game to suffer 
The taunts and yells of the outrageous fans, 
Or to dodge the curves and drops of an erratic 
pitcher, 
And, by my coolness 'scape them? To wait—to 
walk,—
No more; and by a walk to say we stroll 
To first, and then be daring like Ty Cobb, 
And work the Double Steal,—'tis a consummation 
Devoutly to be wished. To walk—to steal— 
To steal. Perchance to score. Ay, there's the rub;— 
For in that Double Steal what chance may come 
When we have rattled the opposing pitcher, 
Must give us runs; there's the respect 
That makes a walk of so long life; 
For who would bear the yells and taunts of fans, 
The urnpire's wrong, the bleachers' contumely, 
"The pangs of disprized hope, the games delay, 
The insolence of gamins, and the spurns 
That one must take from the unknowing 
When he himself his fame might make

By a 2-bagger? Who would roastings bear, 
To grunt and swear under a weary game, 
But that the dread of somethiug after it, 
The Minor Leagues, from whose ranks 
No old time star returns, startles the mind;- 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
Than fly to others whence we ne'er return? 
These bleachers do make cowards of us all; 
And thus the fumble of a hard-hit grounder, 
Is yelled at by the bleacher mob, 
And, thus in places of great chance and moment, 
We all make bone-head plays that lose the game.

Why "Pug" Dugan called McCarty Out.
No wonder that "Pug" Dugan
	Wore a perpetual scowl,
No wonder that unto him
	Life's skies seemed ever foul!
For "Pug" a "has-been" pitcher,
	Now held an umpire's job,
And heard himself called daily:
	"Rube,""robber,""soak" and "slob"
"Pug" brooded o'er his troubles,
	The scowling, howling fans, 
The bickering, blustering players,
	The captains with their "damns!"
He swore that he no longer
	His troubles would endure,
And planned a way to end them
	That would be swift and sure!
That day, the Wolves, the home team, 
	The Bisons were to play.
The whole of Wolfburg journeyed
	To see their heroes play.
The Bisons led the leagues now, 
	But the Wolves held second place,
And if they beat the Bisons
	The wolves would lead the race.

Through six exciting innings 
	"Pug's" umpiring was good; 
No jeers carne from thc rooters, 
	No player him withstood. 
Then came the seventh inning 
	(The fierce game still a tie), 
And "Pug" unto himself said, 
	"The time arrives to die!" 
McCarthy, of the home team, 
	The bison's twirler faced. 
The first ball pitched he clouted; 
	In vain the fielder chased.
McCarthy, made the circuit 
	While the joy-crazed multitude 
Yelled "Rah for Dan McCarthy! 
	We're one run to the good! 
But in that merry moment 
	The umpire raised his hand. 
A hush fell on the ball-field, 
	on bleacher, box and stand. 
"Hold on there!""Pug" spake loudly, 
	"D'ye think my eyes were shut? 
McCarthy's out! The first bag 
	By a full yard he cut!

The bleachers gave a war-whoop! 
	The grandstand joined its roar!
The scribes within the press-box,
	Bawled loudly for "Pug's" gore!
But ere their was wrath vented,
	McCarthy grabbed the bat 
That knocked that honest homer,
	And laid the umpire flat. 
Up rushed the other Wolves then, 
	Their heels in him they dug, 
And the punches they rained on him 
	Made jelly out of "Pug!" 
Up came the maddened rooters, 
	A fierce, blood-thirsty swarm, 
They made the umpire shapeless 
	By stamping on his form ! 
Cried police, judges, preacher: 
	"Leave not a shred of him!" 
Save Bisonburg, the land cried:
	"He earned it! Devil's limb!" 
They buried "Pug," unprayed-for, 
	In marshy, worthless land, 
And no one ever dreamed that he 
	Just such a death had planned,

afternoon in such shape that he could barely walk 
straight. When he went to bat he complained to 
the umpire tha the saw three bats and three balls. 
" Take the middle bat and hit the middle ball,' 
he was advised. 
He took three vigorous swings and was struck 
out. 
"'Why didn't you do as I suggested?' asked the 
umpire. 
"'I did,' said the player, 'but I hit with the out- 
side of the bat, and that's why I missed.'"

A Good Scheme.
Some ball players shirk in their work just as lazy 
men do in factories or in other branches of labor, 
according to an Eastern magnate. 
Many ingenious excuses to obtain holidays have 
been framed up, but we used to have a fellow who 
wasn't satisfied with verbal excuses, but who actual- 
ly disabled himself. He was expert at bunting, and 
could judge a pitched ball so closely that he could 
hit with any part of his bat. One day he was acci- 
dentally hit on the index finger of his right hand, 
the digit being crushed so that he was unfit for duty 
for two weeks. Well, after that he used to smash a 
finger regularly, varying the trick occasionally by 
letting the ball hit his second finger. 
"As a result of his conniving, he played only thir- 
ty garnes that season, and drew full pay. He 
became known as the champion hard luck' player."

A Good-Natured Josh
  A Southern League player tells a yarn on a mem-

  "The beanerite at the time was playing amateur
ball in a little Texas town called Hubbard City, and
Shelton, a great kidder, was managing Temple, Tex.
He wanted a pitcher and the S.L man told him of 
the Boston guy. Shelton wired him and the kid came
on the first train. Next day he was put in the box
and the life hammered out of him, the opponents
making nineteen hits in five innings. In that inning
the Boston party asked Shelton what he thought of 
his work. Shelton smiled, saying: "Young man, 
you are doing splendid. They've not made a single
off of you yet; although they have made a nineteen 
hits- all doubles, triples and homers." Bean eater

The honey of spring was in the air
  The day was one for joy,
But he sat at his desk and didn't care
  And he growled at the office boy.

He nursed a big grouch--the world looked dark-
  He only grumbled and frowned; 
He grabbed his hat and went to the park 
  To see the home team downed.
 
For eight innings he sat—not a feeling of pride, 
  Though the game was close and fast;— 
He looked for defeat, though the game was tied 
When they took the field for the last.
 
Three men got on bases, chances looked slim,
  A score seemed as sure as fate.
He muttered a prayer, and his smile was grim 
  As the batter strode to the plate.
 
The pitcher gazed, his arm held high, 
  And smiling, tossed his head. 
The batter swung-the rooters sighted 
As the ball for the outfield sped.

Of all the inscrutable creatures there be 
A top of the earth or below in the sea. 
The ump is the beatenest being, sure, He 
Consorteth apart in mystery. 
His integument's blue, there's a pad on his chest, 
His frontal is masked and his features unguessed; 
On his mind is a cap, and—well, as for the rest 
Whatever it be, its the subject of jest. 
Oh, the ump's a pariah—the other team's tool 
He bawls out decisions and balls up each rule; 
He sure gets the vote 
As the champion goat; 
There is never a crowd to be in the same boat, 
The umps get their bumps, but this to b 
There is balm (vernal plasters) in Gilead. 
The ump is a seer who was born with a cad; 
The ump is a Solomon—under a pall ; 
One time he's the Saint, and the nest 
The ump's like the place Caesar tells of-all Gaul.

(In the sumnler no doubt he likes batters to fan), 
And if the armed foe should rebel at the plan 
It's the bench quick for him and proscription by 
Ban. 
Oh, the ump is a monarch, a pocket size Czar;
He could even give points in that line to T.R. 
He is always emphatic 
And often erratic; 
The alienists say he has dust in his attic. 
But brush him a bit and proceedings he stops— 
And then strides from the field midst a cordon

"You may," the boss said gently,
  Gazing at Willie the while,
And Willie's look as he stood there
  Was totally free from guile.
His head bowed low with sorrow,
  He slowly went outside,
While gloom hung over the office,
  And the secretary cried.

"Old Nick" Young, as his friends call him, the
veteran ex-president of the national Baseball
League, and one of the most faithful as well as best
natured of "fans" on the continent, maintains a box
at the Washington ball park, for the purpose, one
might suppose, of inviting his friends to witness the
slaughter of the "Senators" by the various visiting
teams. Nick is notably fond of young people, and
has an appreciative eye for pretty girls, a bevy of 
whom always may be seen occupying the front
seats in his choicely located box. The young ladies
have to pay for this privilege, however, by listening
to the funny stories of the veteran, who by the
way, is old enough to be the grandfather of great

"I was down in South Carolina, a few days ago,
in  the town of Greenville. You know i nver can

was a double-header on between Greenville and her
greatest rival, Spartanburg, why it was to me to the
park! Well the place was packed, and the only 
seats to be had were in the bleachers. that South

the request of a physician a telegrapher at the park
ticked to the operator up town and asked him 
to send down the ambulance. Just a little while
after this excitement had passed two partisans of
the rival towns began mixing blows with their argu-
ments. The officer on duty yanked them out of
their seats and called to the operator: 
"Wire the chief to send out the patrol wagon!'"
"The obliging operator hustled the message over
the wire.
"'Sure!' ticked back the man. 'When do you

Like Kellie Did 
Bill Sweeney was a backstop on the mooted Bug-
ville team:
At winging down to second base Bill Sweeney was
a dream; 
The rooters used to swear by him, he their joy
and pride,
Until he tried to emulate the famous "Kelley
slide." 
For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base
and slide, 
Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his 
stride; 
And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time
the rooters cried 
They'd change the yell from Kelley and would
screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"
But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of
speed, 
While Sweeney had a cracking whip but great 
speed seemed to need; 
And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-
ible, and slid. 
The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He 
did?--Like Kelley did!" 
For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-
ed a bag,
And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle 
up and lag; 


****** Result for Image/Page 53 ******
And when he'd start the fans would yelp together 
as a man: 
"O, Sweeney, he can steal a base! He can?—Like 
Kelley can!" 
Now, Sweeney was bullheaded, and he didn't seem 
to know 
He hadn't speed enough to beat the slowest kind 
of throw. 
But Sweeney said that Kelley stole a base each 
time he slid,
And so, he'd keep on trying till he stole—like
Kelley did! 
The ninth round came; the visitors had tied the 
single score;
The side retired, the home boys came to bat amid 
a roar.
Bill opened with a double and was booted down to 
third;
Then rose the loudest rooting, Sweeney swore, he
ever heard.
The next two died ere reaching first, and Bill was
held on third.
Up stepped the heavy sticker of the team, a clout-
in bird.
But while Bill pawed the ground at third, out yelled
a zealous fan:
"O, Bill can steal home base and win! He can?
Like Kelley can!"


****** Result for Image/Page 54 ******
Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift
and livid flame!
At last the time was come to act—immortalize his
name!
His daily practice had improved his speed—he'd
sure make good! 
He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like
Kelley could! 
And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,
Bill sprang from third! 
"Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but
Sweeney never heard 
A hush fell on the multitude—a silence deep, pro- 
found, 
While Bill dived to the earth and plowed up twenty 
feet of ground. 
In Bugville's potter's field to-day there is a little
plot, 
And o'er it stands a painted board which marks 
Bill's resting spot; 
And those who run may read these words: "At 
last the fans are rid 
of Sweeney, who stole home and Won! He did?
—Like Kelley did!"

When Murphy bunts, and gets to first, 
We cheer his feat with pride; 
The ball twists slowly down the line, 
And never rolls outside. 
When Casey makes a sacrifice, 
His deftness moves us all, 
But, Oh, the real hi-hi-ing comes 
When Mooney stings the ball!

For Mooney has a nervous way
Of handling his bat.
The pitchers hate to watch his eyes; 
They don't know where they are at. 
He stands there ready with the stick 
Upon the sphere to fall. 
And, oh, the crowd lets out a yell 
When Mooney stings the ball! 
***Stanza
Yes, Mooney was designed by fate 
To make the pitchers mourn. 
The foxy inshoots and the wides 
He lets pass by with scorn. 
He stands regardless of the crowd, 
The strikes, the umpire's call,

It moves us when the center field 
Pulls fdown the fly he's cursed,
It thrills us when the shortstop's throw 
Cuts off a man at first, 
But, oh, the fierce excitemet when, 
The bases filled, we all 
Leap up and howl, and dance, and yell, 
When Mooney stings the ball!

As the season draws near for baseball, little
Hank, who in ordinary times is looked upon as a boy 
with a great deal of truth and uprightness in his 
make up, seeks a secluded corner somewhere to 
look over the news of the times relating to his 
favorite game, and there decides that on the day of 
the opening of the season's games, some well be- 
loved member of his family must give up the ghost. 
Hank is in a quandary to know whether it shall be 
Grandma, Uncle, Granpa, Aunt, Papa or mamma, but 
finally decides to cinch the argument, that he will
make himself a half orphan that day by telling
teacher, that papa died.  Result; Hank sees game.

How could he expect to Escape?
A now well-known twirler once drifted down into
Arkansaw in search of material for his team.  He
was roughing it, and his appearance was not calcula- 
ted to inspire the local landlords with confidence. 
In one town he was shown to a room on the second 
floor, reached through a number of winding pass- 
ages, From the one window it was a drop
to the ground.  "Say, how could I get out of this 
place in case of fire?" he asked the landlord, who 
had brought up his grip.  The landlord eyed him 
coldly.  "Wall," he drawled, "all you would hev to 
do would be to show ther night watchman--the one
with ther shotgun—a receipted bill fo' yo' board an' 
lodgin'an'get him ter tie up ther bulldorg."

A Delicate Proposition. 
The manager of an asbestos mill in the west con- 
ceived a novel idea for New Year's announcements. 
He had them printed on thin asbestos and inclosed 
in envelopes of the same material. As he was un- 
certain of the correct addresses of some of the 
stockholders he ordered his stenographer to write 
on each envelope "Please forward." 
The idea was clever, but one may appreciate the 
feelings of the widow of one of the stockholders 
when she received an asbestos envelope addressed 
to her late husband, with the inscription "Please 
forward" beneath the address.
