Like Kellie Did 
Bill Sweeney was a backstop on the mooted Bug-
ville team:
At winging down to second base Bill Sweeney was
a dream; 
The rooters used to swear by him, he their joy
and pride,
Until he tried to emulate the famous "Kelley
slide." 
For Bill had seen this Kelley steal base after base
and slide, 
Had noted carefully his walk, his manner, and his 
stride; 
And Sweeney wished a thousand ways each time
the rooters cried 
They'd change the yell from Kelley and would
screech: "Slide, Sweeney, slide!"
But Kelley was a player with a wondrous burst of
speed, 
While Sweeney had a cracking whip but great 
speed seemed to need; 
And though he copied Kelley's style, when pos-
ible, and slid. 
The fans yelled: "Sweeney stole a base!  He 
did?--Like Kelley did!" 
For Sweeney was a moving van whene'er he reach-
ed a bag,
And when he tried to steal his feet would tangle 
up and lag;
