A Delicate Proposition. 
The manager of an asbestos mill in the west con- 
ceived a novel idea for New Year's announcements. 
He had them printed on thin asbestos and inclosed 
in envelopes of the same material. As he was un- 
certain of the correct addresses of some of the 
stockholders he ordered his stenographer to write 
on each envelope "Please forward." 
The idea was clever, but one may appreciate the 
feelings of the widow of one of the stockholders 
when she received an asbestos envelope addressed 
to her late husband, with the inscription "Please 
forward" beneath the address.

wife, and I have never been mixed up in a divorce 
case."
