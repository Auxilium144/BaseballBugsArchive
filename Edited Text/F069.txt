Ode to the Slugger.
Who is it that wins all the praise, 
Receives the burden of the day's
Applause? And has a friend who pays
For whate'er roughhouse he may raise?
THE SLUGGER.
Who makes us howl with ecstasy, 
Who makes us yowl with fervent glee, 
Who gets a hand each time that he 
Strides to the plate with motion free? 
THE SLUGGER. 
Who is it that with score a tie, 
With bases full and feeling high, 
Can let a perfect strike go by 
And not expect at once to die? 
THE SLUGGER. 
Ball Players the people all adore 
And heroes who have gone before: 
All sorts of bigwigs, by the score. 
But there is one whom they love more, 
THE SLUGGER. 
The golden rule. When in doubt, blackguard
the umpire.
