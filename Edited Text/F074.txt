***Poem/Song
When Mooney stings the ball. 
When Murphy bunts, and gets to first, 
We cheer his feat with pride; 
The ball twists slowly down the line, 
And never rolls outside. 
When Casey makes a sacrifice, 
His deftness moves us all, 
But, Oh, the real hi-hi-ing comes 
When Mooney stings the ball!
***Stanza 
For Mooney has a nervous way
Of handling his bat.
The pitchers hate to watch his eyes; 
They don't know where they are at. 
He stands there ready with the stick 
Upon the sphere to fall. 
And, oh, the crowd lets out a yell 
When Mooney stings the ball! 
***Stanza
Yes, Mooney was designed by fate 
To make the pitchers mourn. 
The foxy inshoots and the wides 
He lets pass by with scorn. 
He stands regardless of the crowd, 
The strikes, the umpire's call, 
Until the sphere floats o'er the plate— 
Then Mooney stings the ball!
