Bill heard!  Before his eyes there flashed a swift
and livid flame!
At last the time was come to act—immortalize his
name!
His daily practice had improved his speed—he'd
sure make good! 
He now was fleet as Kelley, and could steal—like
Kelley could! 
And then, e'en while the pitcher held the ball,
Bill sprang from third! 
"Go back, you bonehead!"  cried the boss, but
Sweeney never heard 
A hush fell on the multitude—a silence deep, pro- 
found, 
While Bill dived to the earth and plowed up twenty 
feet of ground. 
In Bugville's potter's field to-day there is a little
plot, 
And o'er it stands a painted board which marks 
Bill's resting spot; 
And those who run may read these words: "At 
last the fans are rid 
of Sweeney, who stole home and Won! He did?
—Like Kelley did!"
