It moves us when the center field 
Pulls fdown the fly he's cursed,
It thrills us when the shortstop's throw 
Cuts off a man at first, 
But, oh, the fierce excitemet when, 
The bases filled, we all 
Leap up and howl, and dance, and yell, 
When Mooney stings the ball!

As the season draws near for baseball, little
Hank, who in ordinary times is looked upon as a boy 
with a great deal of truth and uprightness in his 
make up, seeks a secluded corner somewhere to 
look over the news of the times relating to his 
favorite game, and there decides that on the day of 
the opening of the season's games, some well be- 
loved member of his family must give up the ghost. 
Hank is in a quandary to know whether it shall be 
Grandma, Uncle, Granpa, Aunt, Papa or mamma, but 
finally decides to cinch the argument, that he will
make himself a half orphan that day by telling
teacher, that papa died.  Result; Hank sees game.

Don't kick on a rain check, perhaps it's the only 
negotiable check you'll ever get.
